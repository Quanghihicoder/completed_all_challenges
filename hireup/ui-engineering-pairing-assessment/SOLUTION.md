## Managing Multiple SVGs

This project uses **SVGR** to convert SVG files into React components. This allows you to import SVGs as React components with customizable props such as `className`, `style`, and `fill`.

To automate exporting all SVGs as React components, there is a script located at:  
`src/scripts/generate-icon-index.js`

Run the script using:  
```bash
node src/scripts/generate-icon-index.js
```

This will generate an index file for easy imports.

Additionally, an `Icon` component is provided, which lets you import and use any SVG by simply passing its name as a prop â€” no need to import dozens of SVG files individually.
