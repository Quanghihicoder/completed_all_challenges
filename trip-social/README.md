There are some performance concerns; sometimes I send more data than needed in socket on and emit. I also think the memory usage on the client side is not ideal. Additionally, the AWS user data scripts are incorrect. I will work on all these issues and upload a step-by-step tutorial on YouTube. It will take me a month.
